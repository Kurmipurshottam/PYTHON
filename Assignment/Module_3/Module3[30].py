30] What relationship is appropriate for Student and Person ?
 ->  The appropriate relationship between "Student" and "Person" in the context of object-oriented
       programming (OOP) is typically described as an "is-a" relationship, and this relationship is best
       represented by inheritance.
=============Inheritance===============
 ->  Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP where a new class (subclass or derived class)
       can inherit attributes and behaviors from an existing class (superclass or base class).
 ->  The subclass is a specialized version of the superclass, inheriting its features and potentially
       adding or modifying them.
============"Student" and "Person" Relationship=============
 ->  In this scenario, "Student" is a type of "Person." Every student is a person but with additional
       characteristics specific to being a student, such as a student ID, enrolled courses, grades, etc.
 ->  Therefore, it makes sense to model this relationship using inheritance, where "Student" is a
       subclass of "Person."
